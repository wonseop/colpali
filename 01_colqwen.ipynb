    "This notebook demonstrates how to reproduce and enhance the concepts from the Elastic Search Labs blog post '[Searching complex documents with ColPali](https://www.elastic.co/search-labs/blog/elastiacsearch-colpali-document-search)'.\n",

    "**Key Enhancements:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Model Upgrade**: We use the **`TomoroAI/tomoro-colqwen3-embed-4b`** model, a top-performing model on the ViDoRe benchmark.\n",
    "2.  **Real-world Dataset**: We use sample images from the **RVL-CDIP** dataset to demonstrate capabilities on complex, real-world documents.\n",
    "3.  **Robust Connection Logic**: The connection logic automatically detects whether the environment variable specifies a **Cloud ID** or a **Host URL**, ensuring a stable connection."
